This is backend of the Quiz Application where user/admin can create Questionaire and do CRUD operations on it and then also create a random quiz out of those questions based 
on user requirements.
Then user can get that quiz and submit that quiz and in response user will get the score as result/response from the server.
Note- please note that this is backend project and to test it you can use Postman or any other API testing tool.
